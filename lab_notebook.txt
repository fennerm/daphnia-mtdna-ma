Fenner Macrae Megadaph - Mitochondrial Analysis Lab Notebook
===============================================================================

This is continued from a non-digital lab notebook 12/3/16 - 8/22/17

===============================================================================
August 22nd, 2017
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meeting with Sarah
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discussed primer design for amplifying the control region in order to resolve
the conflicting results which we're finding for the NOVOplasty assemblies. Plan
is to amplify in all 9 D. magna starting controls. We should be able to tell by
the fragment size whether the large repetitive mtDNA assemblies are correct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primer Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Used the NOVOPlasty assembly for IB as the reference
(fmacrae/daphnia_mitochondria_MA/illumina_magna_150bp/I/processed/\
create_consensus/IB)
- First trimmed the IB assembly down to only the ranges 11812:12738 and
  555:1541 which should correspond roughly to the ND1 and ND2 genes
respectively.
- Then moved ND1 region in front of the ND2 region and placed a run of Ns in
between.
- Then used web interface of primer3 to choose primers (Max product size 400bp)
(local: proj/research/daphnia_mtdna_ma/megadaph.mtdna/data-raw/primer_design/\
primer3_out.html).
- Using jalview I Muscle aligned the consensus sequences of all isolates with
the ND1 and ND2 sequence.
- Found primers which look good:
(local: proj/research/daphnia_mtdna_ma/megadaph.mtdna/data-raw/primer_design/\
(primers.control_region.fasta)
- Sarah Ok'd the primers.
- While looking into known info about D. magna mtDNA structure we found a very
interesting looking paper about D. galeata mtDNA diversity in Japan (2017). We
had to contact the authors directly to access the paper.
- Also contacted Dieter about whether he has PacBio data for the D. magna
mtDNA.

===============================================================================
August 23rd, 2017
===============================================================================
- Created an R package fen.R.util (https://github.com/fennerm/fen.R.util) to
house code shared between other R packages.

===============================================================================
August 28th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Large reorganization of project github. Local and IBEST directories should
now be kept fairly well in sync using github. Data will still reside only on
IBEST.

===============================================================================
August 30th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Setup my personal python modules as a package (fmbiopy) for easier import and
extensibility.
    - Using pytest for package testing (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

===============================================================================
September 5th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Received a reference sequence for one of the European D. magna clones from
Dieter Ebert's lab. It is 14969 bp, just 20 more than the Chinese reference.
Edited the novoplasty_assemble.py script to use this reference, and bounded it
between 14000-16000 bp. Started running it on the F isolates as a test run.
- Still getting too large/too small assemblies. Edited novoplasty_assemble.py
to also use the given seed as a reference sequence.

===============================================================================
September 6th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Using the fasta sequence as a reference in NOVOplasty seems to make no
difference. Next I'll try just aligning directly to this reference and see if
that works well enough
- Aligned downsampled FA10 reads to the European mtDNA sequence.
- Rotated alignments still looking weird. Large drop in coverage at the split
point then a large increase in coverage. All the reads which align across the
split point are F2F1 oriented.
- Talked to Sarah. We decided to go ahead with Sanger sequencing of the control
regions, and ask Anna for advice.

===============================================================================
September 11th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Sarah checked my primers and decided to used alternatives due to bad GC
content in the ones I suggested. Two sets were ordered. Need to check that we
have everything else for the reaction in lab.

===============================================================================
September 13th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Sarah said she'd ask about long-range Taq primers for sequencing of control
region. Derek volunteered some.
- Lab meeting: Introductions - my presentation slot set for Nov. 29th

Gel Results

Failed. Smearing of large fragments in all samples including negative controls.
I think most likely failure point is extraction due to the low nanodrop
readings. Will redo extraction on fresh animals, and try to be more careful
about sterile technique. Also possible that extension times are too long. Will
try and vary next time.

Gel Results

Another failure - more promising, but dumber reason.
	- Used the primer stocks rather than the diluted aliquots so the primer the
	gel just shows super bright bands at low fragment size. 5 looks like the
	primers are missing (another sloppy mistake). In 3 there is a smear across
	almost the entire lane, 1 also has a smear but less bright.

Gel Results

Program 2: No Bands except positive control (including ladder). Think lanes
leaked. Will rerun next time.

Program 3: All samples with control region primers either smeared or had no
bands. My DNA extractions showed a band at ~500bp with the positive control
primers. Curiously the positive control tissue didn't have a band when paired
with positive control primers.

Met with Sarah, she suggested: Decreasing annealing temperature to 49C and
increasing annealing time to 20s. Annealing temperature could be further
lowered to 47 or 45 later. Decreasing cycle number to 25.

Got 4 new positive control samples (GBB, GBH, FBB, FBH) since the previous one
was exhausted.

Nanodrop Concentrations
-----------------------
GBB - 5.2 ng/uL
GBH - 1.5 ng/uL

Gel Results
-----------
No bands. Back to the drawing board. Possible next steps:

1. Redo extractions, the template might be poor quality or sheared. We're
running out anyway.
2. Add DMSO
3. Try regular Taq
4. Increase primer concentrations

Actual plan:
- Revert to pcr 4 program 3. Run some samples with DMSO. Some samples with
original protocol. Some samples with increased primer concentration. Some
samples with regular Taq.
- Switch negative control to a no template control.

Asked Maia for PCR advise. She said to definitely use the thermocyclers in the
GGG lab rather than the ones in Schaack lab. They worked much better for her.

Read: Long PCR amplification of the entire mitochondrial genome from individual
helminths for direct sequencing (Hu et al., 2007).
- Advised to definitely use long range PCR.
- Decrease extension time to around 60 degrees due to AT rich region.

Google says that freezing polymerase in master mix ruins it I guess. Will have
to dispose of it, very stupid and wasteful mistake.

Taking another look at the primers I think I'd like to redesign them before
going too much further. They have multiple mismatches and I don't really think
that is necessary. Also having longer primers, smaller product would be nice.

Primer Design 2
---------------
Created a MSA with long and short versions of mtDNA assembly, Chinese sequence
and sequence which Dieter sent over. Used the short assembly produced for IB as
a template. Extracted the first 850bp of ND1 to use as a target for the reverse
primer. Then extracted 850bp of shared sequence at the end of the assembly to
use as the forward primer target.

Used primer3 web interface to generate primers. Specified a minimum primer
length of 21bp, GC content of 40-60%, max 3' self-complementarity=0. Excluded
any primers with mismatches to Dieter's sequence. For the second set of primers
I increased the GC content bounds to 30-70 % to get a smaller expected product
size. Sent to Sarah to check.

===============================================================================
September 28th, 2017
===============================================================================
Redid DNA extractions for a bunch of control Daphnia for use in this and future
experiments. Followed Maia's ammended Zymo extraction protocol as before.
Extracted DNA from five animals from 6 control lines (2 Germany, 2 Israel, 2
Finland). Did two extractions from each line for a total of 12 extractions. For
half of the extractions I flash froze the Daphnia in liquid N2 before
homogenizing with pestle. Sarah suggested that this might help to break down
the carapace.

Extractions all went well - all concentrations ~ 20ng/uL with the exception of
one which is ~6 ng/uL. Stored at 4 degrees. Will aliquot and freeze tomorrow.

===============================================================================
September 29th, 2017
===============================================================================
Sarah asked me to send Hannah some mtDNA assemblies for the G lines. The ones I
have now are in pretty bad shape so I started a fresh run. Created a new
NOVOPlasty seed sequence in
fmacrae/daphnia-mtdna-ma/data/ref/magna/mit/novoplasty_seed.fa. To produce the
seed I took the European reference sequence from Dieter and trimmed off
approximately 2000 bp on either end. This should guarantee that incorrect
sequence won't become the initial seed to the assemblies.

===============================================================================
October 20th, 2017
===============================================================================

Fwd Primer 3:
ACC GTA TCG AGG TAG CCC TTT

Rev Primer 3:
TCA ATA GTC GAG TTC TTG TCT GG

Gel Results
-----------
No bands in negative controls.

Positive controls primers: A clear band at <1kb for both polymerases and both
DNA samples. Some extra bands visible >1kb in the F sample with phusion
polymerase. Probably nonspecific amplification.

Primers 3: Clear bands visible at <1kb for both polymerases both tissues. In
phusion G sample a clear band is visible at ~1.7kb

Met with Sarah:
- We agreed that the extra bands in the phusion samples are probably artifacts
  from nonspecific contamination.
- This supports the existing genome sequence for D. magna from Dieter, but
  doesn't solve our problem with artifacts at the ends of the alignments.
- We decided to go ahead and sequence using primer pair 3.

===============================================================================
October 30th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Took a deeper look at the gel from the last PCR and came up with a scenario
  in which the extra bands in Phusion could be legitimate. In some of the G
  assemblies the forward primer 3 could potentially produce an unintended
  ~1.9kb product. If some of the G lines contain a heteroplasmic mixture of
  genomes we might get double banding like those we see in the Phusion gel.
  Sarah and I decided to gel purify the mystery ~1.7kb product in addition to
  the extra bands in the positive control F line.

Gel Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
T5 (Primers 3, G tissue) show single clear band at all annealing temperatures.
T6 (Primers 3, F tissue) show clear but faint band in two annealing
temperatures. Also has a << 1kb non-target band. All phusion samples have a
bunch of non target bands. Clearly the phusion PCR program is just way too
permissive.

Talked with Sarah and we decided to just try to sequence T5 and T6. We will do
another gel extraction with T6 before sequencing to remove the non-target
bands.

Heteroplasmic structural variation will have to be taken into account for
further analysis though. I will look into haplotype assembly to see if we can
find convincing evidence for multiple segregating structural variants in a
single line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gel Extraction 2 - T6 extraction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gel recipe
----------
0.75 g agarose in 50 mL 1X TBE (1.5 %) run at 70V.

Loading Sample
---------------
2.8uL EZ vision 3 dye, 14uL T5 PCR product. Use both sample 5 and 6 from Gel
PCR 1 and run in adjacent lanes.

Got two clear bands for both samples. The smaller fragment size band was also
present in gel extraction 1 - PCR 1 gel but I hadn't paid much attention to it.
It now occurs to me that these two bands might represent real structural
variation and its probably worth sequencing both. Gel extraction will be
carried out on both.

Carried out the gel extractions as before with the Zymo kit except I let
incubate in the elution buffer for 15 minutes prior to eluting.

===============================================================================
- Sent off sequencing samples to ACGT

===============================================================================
November 14th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Got the sanger sequencing data back.

Initial Exploratory Analysis
----------------------------
- Blasted sequences to mtDNA and nuclear D. magna references. 1,2,5,6 appear to
  all be nuclear amplifications.
- 3 shows a fairly clear large inversion in the control region. Its not
  entirely clear how large the inversion is though, because the sequence
  is only ~350 bp.
- There also seems to have been a smaller deletion in the center of the
  insertion.

===============================================================================
November 15th, December 3rd 2017
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis of MtDNA Control Region Sanger Sequences
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Installed R package 'roblanf/sangeranalyseR'.

- Created merged consensus sequences for each of the fwd/rev sanger reads.

Sample IDs:
FBSC-L = Large T5
GASC-L = Large T6
GASC-S = Small T6

- Blasted the three sequences against the nr/nt database:

Sample  Hits
------  ----
FBC-L   No hits, even with relaxed criteria
GASC-L  Lots of partial (Query Cover = 40-55%) hits to insect mRNA sequences
        No Daphnia hits.
GASC-S  ~400-600bp hits to D. magna control region. Then a gap of ~100bp then a
        ~100bp inverted match to D. magna control region.

- GASC-S seems to be the only read which is mitochondrial. The other two are
  likely to be unintended hits to the nuclear genome etc.
- GASC-S confirms an inversion and a large deletion.

===============================================================================
December 3rd 2017
===============================================================================
- Did some simple calculations to figure out approximately how much of the
  output from MarkDuplicates are false positives. See expected_dups.R
- The expected number of duplicates due to random chance was calculated to be
  approximately 4 % of our data. In our D. magna dataset, on average we actually
  lose approximately 30 % of our data. This seems like an acceptable false
  positive rate.

===============================================================================
December 4th, 6th 2017
===============================================================================
- Completely reimplemented the QC pipeline in snakemake.

===============================================================================
December 5th, 6th 2017
===============================================================================
- Ironed out a bunch of bugs in the new pipeline

===============================================================================
December 9th-19th, 2017
===============================================================================
- Have been distracted by lab maintenance work, but finally got the full QC and
alignment pipeline running correctly with some additional improvements: Removal
of unpaired alignments as final stage of pipeline, paramaters for increased
sensitivity used in local realignment step, qualimap reports.

===============================================================================
December 22nd, 2017
===============================================================================
- Have been working on improving my R scripts for variant calling with the
intent of integrating them into the snakemake pipeline.

===============================================================================
December 23rd 2017 - January 12th, 2018
===============================================================================
- Rewriting and debugging the R scripts has been a larger task than anticipated.
They were written in such a way which made reuse quite difficult, and I slacked
off on documentation quite badly in places. I completely rebuilt the core of the
variant calling algorithm and released as an independent package
('fennerm/pmultinom'). Added some tests where I was most unsure of the
algorithm, more tests would be ideal but its not worth the time suck given that
everything seems to be working fine. The main snakemake pipeline now contains
all analysis steps up until multiple comparison correction. Currently queued on
SLURM. Next steps are to rewrite the multiple comparisons, variant annotation
and mutation rate analyses, which should be much quicker.

================================================================================
January 16th, 2018
================================================================================
- Realized that I hadn't transferred quality score conversion step of the old
  pipeline to the new one. Added it and restarted.

================================================================================
January 17th, 2018
================================================================================
- Merged the fmscripts and fmbiopy repos to allow more integration between
  library code and scripts. Also refactored fmbiopy a bit, removing mypy typing
  to add python2 compatibility.
- Got the SLURM submission script to work with the --immediate-submit flag,
  which should make it much faster. Wrote a scheduler script and put it in its
  own repo ('fennerm/snakemake_sbatch_scheduler').

================================================================================
January 18th, 2018
================================================================================
- Wrote a few scripts for subsampling the nuclear alignments before estimating
sequencing error. This should speed this step up substantially which is good
because it takes forever, and is not particularly important.

================================================================================
January 23rd, 2018
================================================================================
- Due to a mistake in the naming of the rotated reference sequence, had to
  restart competitive alignment. This SLURM run should complete all steps up
  until variant calling. I should be able to get the rest of the pipeline
  finished by the time it completes.

================================================================================
January 25th, 2018
================================================================================
- Added variant calling, multiple comparisons correction and variant filtering
  to the pipeline.
- Built fresh snpEff databases in pipe/config/data for variant annotation.

================================================================================
January 31st, 2018
================================================================================
- Ironed out a bunch of miscellaneous bugs. Variant calling is now complete. The
  results look fairly similar to the previous results but we did find ~20 more
  variants total. Next step is to calculate mutation rates.
- Peter McIlroy will be working on amplifying and sequencing a subset of these
  variants this Semester. He'll be starting off on a few homoplasmic variants to
  get the hang of things.
